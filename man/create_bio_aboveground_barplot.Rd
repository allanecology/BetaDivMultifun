\title{create plot "p"}
\usage{
create_bio_aboveground_barplot(
  type = c("grouped", "stacked"),
  yvar_name = "maxsplines",
  plottitle = model_names_selection$modelname,
  errorbar = F,
  pylim = c(0, 0.44)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{type}{is either "grouped", where turnover and nestedness components
are shown in individual bars, or "stacked", where turnover and 
nestedness components are stacked on top of each other.}

\item{yvar_name}{character vector defining the column name of y values. 
Defaults to "maxsplines" as created in `create_restab0`.}

\item{plottitle}{defaults to `model_names_selection$modelname` which is
the current model name as comes out of the pipeline in basic GDM barplots.
Can be changed, e.g. to plot threshold avg models}

\item{errorbar}{logical T or F. If T, error bars (standard errors) are shown.
The name of the errorbar is assumed to be "se_" yvar_name as in `paste0("se_", yvar_name)`
Note that error bars only look good if type is "grouped"}

\item{pylim}{the limits of the y axis. defaults to 0 and 0.44. Note that if errorbars are plotted,
it might be better to set them to ylim = c(-0.22, 0.44)}
