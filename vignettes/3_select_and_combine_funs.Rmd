Here, ecosystem functions which were read in in `1read_raw_dataset.Rmd` and calculated in `2calc_raw_dataset` are further processed. The functions needed for the project *BetaDivMultifun* are selected and assembled functions are created.


# Create assembled functions
Assembled functions were constructed according to E. Allan (cite project?).

## soilCflxs
Enzymes related to soil C. All measured in the year 2011.
```{r}
sce <- raw_functions[, c("beta_Glucosidase", "N_Acetyl_beta_Glucosaminidase", "Xylosidase")]
soilCflxs <- multidiv(sce, sc="sd", cent=TRUE)[,1]
```

## soilNflxs

## P_loss_comb
