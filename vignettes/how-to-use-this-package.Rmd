# Resources used
To create the package, I used the blogposts of: [Hilary Parker](https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/)
and TODO fill in who else

# installing this package
1. Download the whole folder of github.
2. set the R working directory to the parent folder of the downloaded package. (e.g. Downloads if you stored the package folder in Downloads.)
```{r}
setwd("<parent-directory-of-the-package>")
install("multiFunBetadivLuiGDM")
```
