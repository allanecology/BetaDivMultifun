# SENSITIVITY - PCA AXES SELECTIONÂ¨

# Does it matter if I take different number of PCs?
# here, comparison of first 11, 13 and 14 axes.

# also contains useful pairs() function.

# note : the below file was created by changing the number of selected PCA axes to
#    11, 13 and 14 and saving the output into a data.table.
#    in order to reproduce, use the file "calc_multifun_from_imputed.Rds" and
#    run everything until the pca, until the line : 
#    "saveRDS(EFmaster, "EFdistance.rds")" and instead of saving, keep the data.table
#    and rerun the above section with a different number than 11.

# result : the EFdist measures with 13 or 14 instead of 11 axes are highly correlated with
#    each other c > 0.98
#    note (limitation) : high number of replicates, therefore higher correlation expected.
# conclusion : the EFdist measure is robust to a deviating number of PC axes selected.
