This Vignette relies on the BExIS grassland functions dataset.
TODO : add information on where to get it/ ask for access

It also relies on a soil information dataset
TODO : get more information on where this comes from.
Clay	Fine.Silt	Medium.Silt	Coarse.Silt	Fine.Sand	Medium.Sand	Coarse.Sand	pH	Soil.depth


```{r}
#USER : insert path to grassland function file and read in as grlfuns (uncomment line below)
# grlfuns <- data.table::fread("<pathto_grl_functions.csv>", header=T)
```

# packages
```{r}
#TODO make sure the packages will be named at each function call such that they don't need to be loaded.
require(missForest) ; require(corrplot) ; require(data.table)
```



check distributions
normality?

log transform non-normally distributed ones
