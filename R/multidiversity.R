#'
#' @param x a vector?
#' @param n Specifies the number of values which are chosen for mean calculation.
#' 
#' @return The maximum based on several values (e.g. mean of top 5).

#' Calculate multifunctionality
#'
#' created by Eric Allan
#'
#' @param x Input data frame or matrix. Rows are different diversities/ functions for multifun/div calculation. Columns are
#' replicates, e.g. plots.
#' @param threshold can be a proportion of the maximum e.g. 0.5 or can be the median or mean. It can also 
#' be a vector of the same length as the number of diversities to allow different thresholds for different diversities.
#' threshold = FALSE calculates the mean of the scaled diversities or functions
#' @param sc scaling can be by any function specified in "sc", i.e. max, mean, sd etc., max is the default. If the maximum 
#' should be a mean of the top n values specify sc = "maxx", mx = n
#' @param mx only if sc = "maxx", when the maximum should be a mean of the top n values, mx = n. 
#' @param cent centering by the mean is possible with cent = TRUE, to take z-scores of the diversities/processes, use sc="sd" and cent = TRUE
#' @param by specifies a vector of the same length as nrow(x) to be used to split the data and use different thresholds for the groups in "by"
#' @param weights allows different weightings for the different diversities/functions and should be a vector of the same length 
#' as the number of diversities/functions (shorter vectors will be recycled) to weight a diversity as 0 and drop it from the calculation, 
#' code the weight as "NA" 
#' the default is weights = 1: all diversities weighted the same
#' 
#' @return matrix with 2 columns, the first column is the multidiversity/ -functionality of each plot, the second being the 
#' number of measured (non NA) functions per plot.
#' @examples
#' # create fantasy dataset with 3 functions f1, f2 and f3 and 30 plots.
#' set.seed(2)
#' fundataset <- data.table::data.table(f1 = runif(30, min=0, max=100), f2 = runif(30, min=0, max=1), f3 = runif(30, min=0, max=10))
#' # calculate multifunctionality of this dataset, being the proportion of functions per plot which exceed the threshold of 0.5
#' # of the mean of maximum 5 functions.
