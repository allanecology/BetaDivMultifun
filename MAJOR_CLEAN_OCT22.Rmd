# Documentation of cleaning

This is a documenation of the cleaning round in October 2022. Mainly serves to create a searchable commit. But also to keep track of changes.

## next step

-   merge scripts alpha_plots.Rmd and introductory_plots.Rmd

## Major topics of scripts

-   data assembly (create input data) ok
-   analysis (create output data)
-   visualisation and summarising (create summaries and plots from output data)

## Documentation of cleaning

-   `plot_GDM.Rmd` :
    -   removed `automaticrun` variable : all runs are automatic from now.

    -   chosing model from `model_names`.
-   reading in LUI input : before I gave the variable `compon_lui` by hand, now this is called `lui` and taken from `model_names_selecton$lui`.

**small datasets**

small datasets that are stored in /vignettes are transferred to /data

`usethis::use_data(\<nameofdataset\>)` if necessary with `overwrite = T` to overwrite existing dataset

No loading is needed, because R packages use "lazy-loading", i.e. only load data when necessary.

**model_names**

will be used uniquely to select the current model to run, or to run all of them.

names need to be cleaned!

-   model_names column "name" renamed to "modelname"

-   added columns : funs, lui containing more info about the selected model --\> reduce the amount of hand-filled input

-   `model_names` column `luiinput` will not be used in the future any more : there will not be a model with all 3 components together, but only with individual ones. (because LUI components are correlated.)

## Problematic scripts

-   GDM_multifun_thresholds

**prepare_and_run_GDM.Rmd**

implement the use of the `model_names` table. Select used models with `model_names_selection`.

-   `funs` needs to be changed to `model_names_selection$funs`

-   compon_luli is depreciated: use `lui` instead

-   replaced `modelname` with `model_names_selection$modelname`

## Sequence of analysis steps

-   is in file `the_analysis_hive.Rmd` now. (hive-drone wording is used here)

## clean

Evaluate if useful content is in there, think about what to do later.

-   [ ] GDM_multifun_betadiv_lui_analysis.Rmd

# Re-Analysis

Take care that the following points are included in re-analysis :

-   %var expl. plot is re-done. Seems there was an error in manually entering the values in a large table. New : use the small tables extracted for each model and rbind them to a full table of model specs.

-   Implement permutations in `plot_GDM.Rmd`.
